Movie Recommender System (MovieLens 100k)

This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using:

Python

Surprise (SVD collaborative filtering)

Streamlit for the user interface

MovieLens 100k dataset

Manual anti-testset logic (no build_anti_testset)

Direct file paths only (no os, no pathlib)

The system predicts ratings for unseen movies and recommends the top-N movies to a given user.
