#Movie Recommender System (MovieLens 100k)

This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using: **Python**, **Surprise (SVD collaborative filtering)**, **Streamlit**, **MovieLens 100k dataset**, **Manual anti-testset logic (no build_anti_testset)**, **Direct file paths only (no os, no pathlib)**. The system predicts ratings for unseen movies and recommends the top-N movies to a given user.

##Features

- Collaborative filtering using SVD

- Manual creation of anti-testset

- Streamlit UI for easy interaction

- Clean training and prediction pipeline

- Notebook included for reproducibility
